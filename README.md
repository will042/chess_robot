![System Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/will042/chess_robot/master/images/ChessRobot.png)

This is a project to develop a voice controlled chess robot. A Universal Roboticsâ€™ UR5e collaborative robot is used with a Robotiq Hand-E Gripper to manipulate chess pieces. A computer with Python 3.8, is used to accept voice commands, interpret and relay cartesian coordinates to the UR5e, and track the state of the chess game.
